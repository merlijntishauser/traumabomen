## What Is Not Original

1. **Family tree visualization** is a solved problem with dozens of implementations.
2. **Genogram-style psychological annotation** has existed since the 1970s (Murray Bowen) with multiple digital implementations.
3. **Relationship type modeling** (biological, step, adoptive, partner) is standard in genogram tools.
4. **End-to-end encryption** exists in some family apps (Famstory) and some mental health apps (SoulSync, Intellect).

## What Is Original

1. **The specific combination is unique.** No tool combines all of: (a) interactive web-based family tree, (b) structured trauma event tracking with categories and severity, (c) zero-knowledge encryption, and (d) positioning as a personal self-reflection tool.

2. **Zero-knowledge encrypted genogram/trauma data is unoccupied.** Genogram tools are either clinical (HIPAA, therapist-owned) or local-only desktop apps. None offer a web app with true zero-knowledge encryption.

3. **Personal self-reflection framing is rare.** Nearly every genogram tool is designed for therapists operating on clients. Traumabomen is for individuals mapping their own family patterns without professional intermediation.

4. **Structured trauma event model with categories and severity.** Genogram tools use freeform notes and relationship lines. The academic "Color-Coded Timeline Trauma Genogram" (Jordan, 2004) and the "Transgenerational Trauma and Resilience Genogram" (TTRG) describe this concept in research, but no commercial tool implements it as a first-class digital feature.

5. **Dual visualization (tree + timeline).** Both a tree visualization and a generational timeline view side by side is distinctive.

## Academic Precedent

The closest conceptual match comes from research literature, not commercial tools:

- Jordan, K. (2004). "The Color-Coded Timeline Trauma Genogram." -- Proposes structured trauma annotation on genograms with color coding.
- Goodman, R.D. (2013). "The Transgenerational Trauma and Resilience Genogram (TTRG)." -- Framework for mapping trauma and resilience across generations.

Neither has been implemented as a digital tool.
